# JavaScript Exercises

Here there are the exercises proposed by the professor during the lab sessions. These exercises were introduced after reviewing a series of examples located in the "Examples" folder. 

Styling was not a requirement for these tasks, but I chose to add some styles to enhance the presentation.

## Exercise 1: Form Validation

In this exercise, you will validate a form for subscribing to a mailing list.

### Instructions

- In `index.html`, there is a form containing two text inputs: **nickname** and **email**.
- Write JavaScript code to validate the two fields:
  - Both fields (nickname and email) must not be empty.
  - The email field must follow the proper email format.
- **Do not modify the HTML code!**

## Exercise 2: Dynamic Cards

In this exercise, you will create dynamic cards based on an array of data.

### Instructions

- In `script.js`, there is an array of dictionaries, each containing a **title**, an **URL**, and a **description**.
- Implement the function `createCard()` that dynamically creates cards similar to those already present in the `index.html`, one for each data structure in the array.
- **Do not modify the HTML code!**

## Exercise 3: Grade Average Calculation

In this exercise, you will calculate the average of a series of grades.

### Instructions

- In `index.html`, there is an input field and a button.
- Write JavaScript code that, given a sequence of grades of unknown length, returns the following:
  - A list of the entered grades.
  - The minimum and maximum grades.
  - The arithmetic mean and a synthetic judgment (6 ranges between 18 and 33).
  - Variability represented as "mean error" and a synthetic judgment (4 ranges between 0 and 7.5).
- Each grade must be a number between 18 and 33; ensure proper input validation.
- Define a `Statistics` object to perform all calculations.
